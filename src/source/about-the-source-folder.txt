This folder contains the original Julia source files that used Literate.jl to build the Markdown and Jupyter notebook versions. The Markdown versions were then automatically converted to HTML by the JuDoc.jl server.

The files from 2019 are converted to JuDoc-compatible (from Jekyll-compatible) syntax, mainly the code-highlight and metadata stuff. I didn't bother with the files from 2018 and earlier... :)
