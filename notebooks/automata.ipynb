    "A cellular automaton is a mathematical model that creates patterns automatically according to simple rules. In its simplest, one-dimensional form, it's a row of empty squares, each of which can be occupied or empty. The rules for the model determine how sensitive the occupants of each square are to their immediate left and right neighbours, and whether, after some unspecified time, they survive or die. Sometimes empty squares can miraculously become occupied. Because a square has just two immediate neighbours, there are 8 different cases to consider, ranging from all empty (\"□□□\" or `000` in binary) to all full (\"■■■\" or `111`)."
